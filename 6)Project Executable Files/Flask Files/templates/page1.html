                <p>Renewable energy refers to energy derived from natural
                    resources that are continuously replenished. Unlike fossil
                    fuels, which are finite and contribute to environmental
                    pollution, renewable energy sources are sustainable and have
                    minimal impact on the planet. These sources include solar
                    energy, wind energy, hydropower, geothermal energy, and
                    biomass. By harnessing these abundant resources, we can
                    reduce our dependence on non-renewable fuels and mitigate
                    climate change.</p>

                <p> Wind energy is generated by capturing the kinetic energy of
                    moving air using wind turbines. These turbines consist of
                    large blades mounted on a tower. As the wind blows, it
                    causes the blades to rotate, which drives a generator to
                    produce electricity. Wind farms are strategically located in
                    areas with consistent wind patterns, such as coastal regions
                    or open plains. The efficiency of wind energy production
                    depends on factors like wind speed, turbine design, and
                    maintenance. With advancements in technology, wind power has
                    become a significant contributor to global electricity
                    generation, offering a clean and sustainable alternative to
                    traditional fossil fuels.</p>
